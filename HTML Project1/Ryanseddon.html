        <p>Homebridge has been an amazing contribution to connecting most of my home into a single automation platform.
            If youâ€™ve read this blog youâ€™ll know that Iâ€™ve electrified my home and dumped fossil gas into the past where
            it belongs. Bringing solar into HomeKit Part of electrifying my home was adding solar and Iâ€™ve talked about
            how Iâ€™ve extracted data from my realtime circuit hardware via a dashboard created with a magtag device on my
            fridge. <a href="" style="text-decoration: none;"> Continue reading</a></p>

        <p>Letâ€™s start with the acknowledgment that I am in a very privileged position to be able to do this to a home I
            own. I
            do believe that my home will be commonplace in the coming decade, clean, fossil fuel-free, and efficient. I
            just got
            here earlier as I had the means and passion to be an early adopter. I electrified my home about 18 months
            ago but
            have only now clocked over 12 months of an electric home with rooftop solar.<a href=""

        <p> Every year I produce a timelapse video of my @earthin24 twitter bot for each of the 5 satellites that it

            This year
            was the first year I built, tweeted, and stored each video and fulldisc frame inside github using their
            actions
            infrastructure. So my usual process of sshâ€™ing into my VPS and running some flaky scripts to generate the
            videos

        <p>
            I recently had the privilege of being able to install solar on my roof and with that came the need/want to
            track and
            monitor lots of information about my solar install and my usage patterns of it. Having recently electrified
            my home
            and completely removing gas all together (I plan to write about this too), I wanted to know where I could
            load shift
            some of my usage patterns. Another aspect of monitoring was to know my panels were performing at their
            optimal, and
            expected, output.<a href="" style="text-decoration: none;">Continue reading.</a>

        <p>At work my team have recently taken over a golang app. To learn a new language I like to build something that
            keeps
            my interest and by the nature of exploring something of interest you tend to cover way more surface area of
            a

        <p>September 2015 I had the privelage of giving a talk at JSConfEU 2015 in Berlin. My topic was about what the
            browser actually does to construct your website and show it on the screen. This is a topic Iâ€™ve been digging
            into for a few years now and it was really fun trying to distill it into a ~25 minute talk.
